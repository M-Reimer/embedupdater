EmbedUpdater Firefox addon
==========================

Many big video portals allow to play their videos using HTML5. This makes it possible to disable/uninstall Flash if you only need it to play video.

With migrating to HTML5 those video portals also changed the way how their videos should be embedded into other pages. Videos embedded using the embed code of the "pre-HTML5-era" don't play with HTML5 but force you to use Flash.

This addon updates such "off-site" embeds so the HTML5 player can be used.

An example page to test this addon can be found here:
